- What's the ONE thing users will do most frequently?
  Model various economic conditions and compare current portfolio positions with proposed portfolio positions.

- What user action is absolutely critical to get right?
  To upload account information in it's raw form and have the application populate information accurately.

- What should be completely effortless for users?
  When the user clicks to compare plans, the results contain all the critical information yet is easy to understand.

- If we nail one interaction, everything else follows - what is it?
  To upload account information in it's raw form and have the application populate information accurately.

===

Okay, I have the core user action defined. Next, I'll move to platform requirements, as per  
 step-03-core-experience.md. Here are the platform questions:

"Let's define the platform context for fidelity-ira-modeling:

Platform Questions:

- Web, mobile app, desktop, or multiple platforms?
  Web

- Will this be primarily touch-based or mouse/keyboard?
  Mouse and keyboard

- Any specific platform requirements or constraints?
  The primary user has an old, unsupported Mac. She's using MacOS 10.15.5. Her Google Chrome version is 128.0.6613.138.

- Do we need to consider offline functionality?
  Yes

- Any device-specific capabilities we should leverage?"
  No

=====

Effortless Experience Design:

- What user actions should feel completely natural and require zero thought?
  Understanding the economic conditions they are modeling for.

- Where do users currently struggle with similar products?
  Setting up their information to be able to start gaining valuable insights.

- What interaction, if made effortless, would create delight?
  Initial set up - uploading account information and the refresh of current positions market price and all other fields are recalculated.

- What should happen automatically without user intervention?
  The refresh of current positions market price and all other fields are recalculated.

- Where can we eliminate steps that competitors require?
  Users need to research where the market is likely to swing. If there could be that research offered in the app, the user would know which economic scenario to model for.

===

- What's the moment where users realize 'this is better'?
  When they feel confident that they understand the meaning of the various results of their modeling sessions. They have a record of the results to compare against each other and it's obvious which plan fared best.

- When does the user feel successful or accomplished?
  When the user has a clear plan of action on how to rebalance their portfolio

- What interaction, if failed, would ruin the experience?
  Creating alternate portfolios.

- What are the make-or-break user flows?
  The user sees their current portfolio accurately displayed.
  The user creates one or two alternate portfolio distributions with available Fidelity options.
  The user picks a preloaded economic scenario or is able to modify to create a unique scenario.
  The user runs simulations and the results are easy to understand.
  At the end of the session, the user feels confident that they understand the meaning of the various results of their modeling sessions. They have a record of the results to compare against each other and it's obvious which plan fared best.

- Where does first-time user success happen?
  The initial set up. The upload of their raw .csv file of account positions downloaded from Fidelity.

===

Now let's think about how fidelity-ira-modeling should make users feel.

Emotional Response Questions:

- What should users FEEL when using this product?
  Empowered and in control

- What emotion would make them tell a friend about this?
  Confident, Efficient and productive.

- How should users feel after accomplishing their primary goal?
  Relief from the anxiety of lack of information

- What feeling differentiates this from competitors?
  Confident they received unbiased advice.

Common emotional goals: Empowered and in control? Delighted and surprised? Efficient and productive?
Creative and inspired? Calm and focused? Connected and engaged?

====

Let's explore how users should feel at different stages of their interaction with the product.

Emotional Journey Considerations:

- How should users feel when they first discover the product?
  Surprised and delighted by a new option / tool. Curious to try it out.

- What emotion during the core experience/action?
  Empowered and in control

- How should they feel after completing their task?
  Delighted

- What if something goes wrong - what emotional response do we want?
  Empowered and in control by information to correct the error

- How should they feel when returning to use it again?
  Efficient and productive

===

Design Implications:

- If we want users to feel Empowered and in control, what specific UX choices support this?

The display of a list Fidelity investment vehicles are appropriate for a specific economic scenario. Understandable descriptions of the types of assets and why they meet the purpose.

- What interactions might create Confusion or Skepticism that we want to avoid?

Inability to understand what models are simulating.
Inability to what financial products are available and know which investment vehicles to choose.
Running multiple simulations and not remembering results to compare and make decisions at the end of the session.

- Where can we add moments of Delight or Surprise?

The app can suggest which models are most relevant to the current economic situation.  
The app will proactively suggest financial products available to the user that are most relevant to the current economic conditions.
The app will proactively suggest financial products available to the user that are most relevant to the economic conditions the user thinks are most likely.

- How do we build Trust and Confidence through design, especially given the financial nature of the product?
  The app gives us a well researched estimate of the likelihood of each economic scenario.
  The app gives us historical performance metrics of each financial product it suggests or the user enters.
  The app shows provides the most common and relevant financial charts for the user to research product / financial vehicle performance.

Emotion-Design Connections (to consider):

- Empowered & In Control → [UX design approach]
- Confident & Productive → [UX design approach]

![Image](https://i.insider.com/56df181f52bcd01d7b8b4b2d?auto=webp&format=jpeg&width=600)

### What it does well (UX fundamentals)

- **Zero-friction onboarding**: Connect accounts → instant payoff.
- **Cognitive offloading**: “We already did the math for you.”
- **Clear information hierarchy**: balances → trends → categories.

### What feels compelling or delightful

- **Immediate clarity**: Users feel smarter in ~30 seconds.
- **Passive usefulness**: You don’t have to _do_ budgeting to feel in control.
- **Soft nudges** instead of lectures.

### What keeps users coming back

- **Habitual checking**: balances + “did I screw up?” reassurance.
- **Low effort / high reward loop**.
- **Trust inertia**: once accounts are linked, switching feels annoying.

**Hard truth:** Mint succeeded because it removed _thinking_. That’s also why it plateaued—no identity beyond “financial dashboard.”

### What it does well (UX fundamentals)

- **Opinionated UX**: No ambiguity about “the right way.”
- **Conceptual consistency**: Every screen reinforces the same mental model.
- **Intentional friction**: You must engage, on purpose.

### What feels compelling or delightful

- **Psychological ownership**: Every dollar has a job → control dopamine.
- **Progress visibility**: Wins are explicit and earned.
- **Narrative UX**: You’re not tracking money—you’re _changing behavior_.

### What keeps users coming back

- **Identity lock-in**: “I am a YNAB person.”
- **Fear of regression**: Leaving feels like giving up discipline.
- **High switching cost (mentally, not technically).**

**Hard truth:** YNAB is a cult—and that’s a compliment. It trades growth for loyalty and wins.

- **Gamified savings** without feeling juvenile.

### What keeps users coming back

- **Ongoing threat model**: “What am I still overpaying for?”
- **Periodic wins** (refunds, reduced bills).
- **Loss aversion**: Users fear missing savings.

**Hard truth:** Rocket Money isn’t budgeting—it’s _financial grievance outsourcing_. Users stay because anger is sticky.

### What it does well (UX fundamentals)

- **High-signal dashboards**: Net worth, allocation, performance.
- **Professional visual language**: Feels serious, not gimmicky.
- **Data credibility**: Numbers feel authoritative.

### What feels compelling or delightful

- **Net-worth voyeurism**: Watching the number move is addictive.

## Cross-App UX Patterns (This Is the Real Signal)

Here’s what _actually_ works across all four:

| Pattern                    | Why it Works                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fast initial payoff**    | Users decide in the first minute if this stays                    |
| **Clear emotional hook**   | Relief (Rocket), control (YNAB), clarity (Mint), status (Empower) |
| **Reduced cognitive load** | Less thinking = more engagement                                   |
| **Habit loops**            | Balance checks, progress tracking, “what changed?”                |
| **Identity formation**     | “This app is how people like me manage money”                     |

---

## Brutally Honest Take

- **Mint** optimized for _scale_
- **YNAB** optimized for _behavior change_
- **Rocket Money** optimized for _emotional relief_
- **Empower** optimized for _trust + authority_

They’re not competing products.
They’re competing **psychological contracts**.

If you want, I can:

- Map these patterns to **recruiting / talent intelligence UX** (very relevant to what you’re building), or
- Extract **design principles you can steal without copying features**, or
- Show why most fintech apps fail because they try to be _two of these at once_.

Pick your poison.

Now let's define what success looks like for our core experience: 'Understand your portfolio, the future, and how to adapt.'

Core Experience Success Criteria:

- What makes users say 'this just works'
  The app give them

- When do they feel smart or accomplished during this process?
- What feedback tells them they're doing it right?
- How fast should it feel?
- What should happen automatically to make this feel seamless?

Here are the core interaction mechanics for the Portfolio Scenario Modeler, designed to empower DIY Dan to move from anxiety to action.

### 1. Initiation

- **How does the user start this action?**
  The experience begins when the user engages with a high-signal "Risk Alert" (e.g., "High Tech Concentration") on the dashboard or clicks the prominent "Run Stress Test" button to proactively check their portfolio's resilience.

### 2. Interaction

- **What does the user actually do?**
  The user engages in a "Model and Compare" loop where they select a historical scenario (like "2008 Crash") and then adjust their asset allocation to see how it improves their outcome.
- **What controls or inputs will they use?**
  They will primarily use fluid drag-and-drop sliders to adjust target percentages for asset classes and simple card-based selectors to switch between different economic scenarios.
- **How does the system respond in real-time?**
  The interface utilizes a split-screen view that updates instantaneously (<100ms), redrawing the "Current" vs. "Proposed" performance charts with every single pixel of slider movement.

### 3. Feedback

- **What tells users they're succeeding?**
  Dynamic "Survival Badges" appear (e.g., "Portfolio Survives Drawdown") and risk metrics shift from red/amber to green as the user finds a safer allocation mix.
- **How does the system communicate the impact?**
  The system explicitly calculates and displays the "Delta" between the two portfolios, showing exactly how much capital is saved or lost in the modeled scenario (e.g., "Proposed Plan saves $15,000 in this crash").
- **What happens if they make a mistake?**
  If allocations don't add up to 100% or violate a constraint, the system highlights the specific slider in red and displays a helpful, plain-English tooltip guiding them to fix the balance.

### 4. Completion

- **How do users know they're done?**
  The process concludes when the user is satisfied with the comparison metrics and clicks the "Generate Trade List" button, which only becomes active once a valid, improved portfolio model is created.
- **What's the successful outcome?**
  The outcome is a clear, downloadable "Action Plan" PDF that translates the theoretical model into a precise checklist of buy and sell orders.
- **What's the natural 'next step'?**
  The immediate call to action is for the user to log into their Fidelity account to execute the trades, closing the loop between analysis and action.
