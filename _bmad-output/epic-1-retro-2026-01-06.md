# Epic 1 Retrospective (2026-01-06)

## Epic Reviewed

- Epic: 1 � Hello, Asset! & The Demo Portfolio
- Status: complete (2/2 stories done)
- Retro Type: full

## Participants

- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Ppgir (Project Lead)
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev)
- Dana (QA Engineer)

## Epic Summary

- Delivery: 2/2 stories complete; review follow-ups closed
- Quality: unit/integration tests added; green locally and in CI
- Technical highlight: encrypted local persistence with Web Crypto wrapper and worker-based key derivation
- User-facing: demo portfolio UI intended to render on first load

## What Went Well

- 100% delivery with no open story tasks
- Early foundational work (crypto + worker) paid off for future performance-heavy features
- Review follow-up loop closed with tests and refactors

## What Was Frustrating or Slower Than Expected

- Crypto + persistence + worker boundaries added complexity and edge cases
- Review hardening (tests, refactors, utilities) created churn but improved quality
- Critical UX issue: blank white page in `npm run dev` (reproducible)

## Key Takeaways

1. Strong delivery discipline and review closure
2. The crypto/worker foundation enables later modeling work
3. A blank first screen is an unacceptable failure mode that current tests did not catch

## Action Items (Owners)

- Create an incident entry for the blank screen with full repro, env, logs, root cause, and prevention (Bob)
- Pin failure mode classification (routing, hydration, env config, build artifact, runtime error swallowed) (Bob)
- Add first-screen smoke test gate (integration or Playwright) (Bob)
- Add dev-mode debugging breadcrumbs: error boundary, boot marker, worker/crypto init logs (Bob)
- Add Definition of Done enforcement: risks/debt must be explicitly recorded as None or listed with follow-up (Bob)
- Define minimum performance instrumentation for Epic 2 and record results in `/docs/perf/` (Ppgir)
- Resolve blank page in `npm run dev` (team)

## Preparation Tasks for Epic 2

- Establish worker orchestration pattern for scenario calculations
- Confirm Recharts integration approach
- Validate MUI slider allocation constraints behavior
- Ensure benchmark capture process is defined before Story 2.1 implementation

## Critical Path Items

- Resolve blank white page in `npm run dev`
- Create and complete incident entry for blank screen
- Add first-screen smoke test gate

## Readiness Assessment

- Testing & Quality: strong automated coverage; green locally and in CI
- Deployment: live in production
- Stakeholder Acceptance: pending due to blank screen (not critical path)
- Technical Health: stable and maintainable
- Unresolved Blockers: none reported

## Next Epic Preview

- Epic 2: Interactive Modeling, Comparison & Action
- Dependencies: portfolio data model, persistence, loading states, baseline UI (in place)
- Known gaps: scenario calculation worker orchestration and performance instrumentation

## Commitments

- Treat blank screen as a pinned incident
- Prevent recurrence with smoke test + debugging breadcrumbs
- Make risk/known-debt logging explicit in Definition of Done

## Final Notes

- Retrospective complete and accepted by Project Lead
